# trello_things3_sync
Sync Things 3 and your GTD Trello Board! 

This was a small project I started to bridge Trello and Things 3. This would essentially run on a macOS server (or your desktop computer) and handles syncing between Trello and Things3.

The way it is written makes it very easy to sync between any two task apps. So if you want to instead sync between Asana and Things 3, that should work.

I'm using a very backdoor way of accessing the underlying objective C datastructures of Things 3. I can't guarantee this will continue to work.

I'm nolonger maintaining this project. After much frustration with the paradigm of Things 3, I switched entirely to Trello. 

**If you are interested in working on it, let me know! I'll document everything for you.**
